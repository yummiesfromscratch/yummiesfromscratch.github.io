This wonderful vegetable roots its ancestry back in India and was cultivated in China in 5th century BC. Make sure you pick eggplants that are firm throughout and has a fresh, hardy, green 'cap'. Eggplants turn brown once cut and left uncooked. You can soak the cut up eggplant in a bowl of water with drizzles of lemon juice to prevent browning. Steaming eggplant is one of the best way to cook eggplant while preserving the vegetable's natural sweetness.
