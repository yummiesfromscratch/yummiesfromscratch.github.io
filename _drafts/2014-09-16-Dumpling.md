Dumpling parties are a great way of making your dinner guests participate in making their food. Dumplings in our house are often made during celebrations such as Chinese New Years where our uncles/aunties would gather together and help to prepare this wonderful and simple dish while us kids roam around the kitchen adding to the festivities.
