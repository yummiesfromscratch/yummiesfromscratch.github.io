Paella, a Valencian-Cataln word derived from the old French word papelle for "pan". Paella is cooked on a specialized shallow pan and is a great party hosting dish. We often cook it over our BBQ grill in the backyard. You can cut and prepare all of your ingredients ahead of time and while cooking the dish, you can enjoy time talking/entertainig guests sipping over glasses of sangria. 


![Paella][1]

Most traditional paella consists of meat (chicken and rabbit), land snails, beans and seasoning. However, similar to Mediterranean coast folks, we get awesome seafood living in SF Bay area on the Pacific Coast. Therefore, I like to prepare mine with lots of fresh and live seafood.

Make sure you get good quality Valencia rice. Whole Foods sell Bomba rice which works very well.
This is made using a Lodge 15" Paella Pan.
