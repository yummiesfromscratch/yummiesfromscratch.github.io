Pita bread is very common in Mediterranean, Balkan and Middle Eastern cuisines and can be eaten with just about everything.

These are simple to make and tastes much better than the store bought ones. Pita can be eaten with just about any dip, from tzatziki to hummus. I often use it instead of English muffin to make an egg-cheese pita pocket.

### Ingredients
- 1 cup flour (4.5 oz by weight)
- 1 cup water
- 1.5 tsp instant yeast
- 1.5 tbsp olive oil
- 1.75 tsp salt
- 1.75 to 2 cup flour (until a soft, slightly sticky dough forms)

### Instructions
1. Make a wet sponge by mixing 1 cup flour, 1 cup water with the 1.5 tsp instance yeast.
1. Let the mixture sit for 10 min to make sure there are little bubbles indicating yeast is good.
1. Add olive oil, salt and remaining flour. Add the initial 1.75 cup flour and more as needed to mkae a soft, slightly sticky dough.
1. Mix well and knead for 5-6 min on the mixer.
1. Put a few drops of olive oil in the mixing bowl and roll the dough in the bowl to cover with olive oil.
1. Cover and let sit to rise for 2 hours until the dough double in size.
1. Remove dough onto a lightly floured surface.
1. Flatten dough and cut into 8 equal size pieces.
1. Take each piece and form a small round ball (pull dough top down and tuck it up on the bottom).
1. Cover the dough balls and let sit for 30 min. (dough should rise)
1. Take each dough ball, roll out into a round circle about 1/4 inch thick.
1. Let the rolled out dough sit for about 5 min before frying on pan. Be sure to cover the other dough while you work on each dough.
1. Take a skillet, lightly oiled, grill each side for 3 min.
1. When you flip the dough back to the original side, the dough should rise and puff up.
