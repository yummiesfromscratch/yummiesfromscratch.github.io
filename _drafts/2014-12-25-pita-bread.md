Dumpling parties are a great way of making your dinner guests participate in making their food. Dumplings in our house are often made during celebrations such as Chinese New Years where our uncles/aunties would gather together and help to prepare this wonderful and simple dish while us kids roam around the kitchen adding to the festivities.

Nothing beats freshly made dumpling skin. Not only is it easier to wrap the filling than the store bought ones, but it is much tastier and has more texture to the taste.
