Mac and Cheese

![Mac and Cheese][1]

Nothing beats freshly made dumpling skin. Not only is it easier to wrap the filling than the store bought ones, but it is much tastier and has more texture to the taste.

### Ingredients
- Kosher salt
- ½ pound cavatappi or elbow macaroni
- 2 cups milk
- 3 tablespoons unsalted butter
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups Gruyere cheese, grated
- 1 cup extra-sharp Cheddar, grated
- 1 teaspoon salt
- ½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
- pinch of ground nutmeg
- ¾ lb pound cooked crab
- ½ cup toasted breadcrumbs
- 2 teaspoons fresh thyme, chopped

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.
1. Add pasta to a large pot of salted boiling water and cook according to the directions on the package, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain well.
1. Meanwhile, heat the milk over low heat in a small saucepan. In a large pot over medium low heat, melt butter. Once butter has melted add the flour. Cook over for 2 minutes, stirring with a whisk. Add the hot milk and cook for a minute or two more, whisking continuously until the sauce has thickened and is smooth. Remove from heat and add the Gruyere, Cheddar, salt, pepper, and nutmeg. Add the cooked pasta and crab and stir well. Place the mixture in 4 gratin dishes or a medium sized oven safe dish.
1. Sprinkle evenly with breadcrumbs and thyme and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbly and the mac n cheese is browned on the top.
