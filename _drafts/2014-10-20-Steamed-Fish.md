![Steamed Black Cod][1]

There has been dispute over the “real creator” of the dish. However, Julia Child’s childhood memories of eating Caesar Salad at Caesar Cardini’s restaurant probably is enough substantial proof. Cardini’s daughter recounted that her father ‘made do’ with what was left in the kitchen on 4th of July 1924 to come up with this now most popular salad dish.

Make sure you use good quality mustard and mayonnaise. Or you can make your own mayonnaise here. If I am not entertaining guests, I substitute mayo with olive oil.
