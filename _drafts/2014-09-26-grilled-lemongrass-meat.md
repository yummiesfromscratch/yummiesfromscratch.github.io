![Lemongrass Chicken][1]

There has been dispute over the “real creator” of the dish. However, Julia Child’s childhood memories of eating Caesar Salad at Caesar Cardini’s restaurant probably is enough substantial proof. Cardini’s daughter recounted that her father ‘made do’ with what was left in the kitchen on 4th of July 1924 to come up with this now most popular salad dish.

Make sure you use good quality mustard and mayonnaise. Or you can make your own mayonnaise here. If I am not entertaining guests, I substitute mayo with olive oil.

### Ingredients
- 4 pounds pork butt or top sirloin or chicken thigh
- 3 shallots, finely minced
- 5 cloves garlic, finely minced
- 1/2 cup lemongrass, finely minced
- 3 tablespoons white sesame seeds
- 1 tablespoon salt
- 1/2 tablespoon black pepper
- 2 tablespoons honey
- 3 tablespoons fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon sesame oil
- 1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil

### Instructions
1. Soak the meat in the marinade for 24 hours in the fridge (overnight).
1. Grill over flame or boil in oven.
