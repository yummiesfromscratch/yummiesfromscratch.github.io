- 1 bird chile, trimmed and minced
- 1 tbsp lime juice
- 2 tsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp tamarind (optional)
- 1/4 cup dry roasted peanuts (processed until coarse powder), [recipe here][2]

Yield: 2 cups

### Instructions
1. Add everything except water and ground peanuts into a mixing bowl.
1. Gradually add water to make into a running paste.
1. Finally, add the roasted peanuts.
1. For an extra kick, add some crushed red pepper flakes.
