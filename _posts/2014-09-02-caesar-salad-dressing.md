This is one of my favorite salad to order at the restaurant. It is such a classic dish that if a restaurant cannot be bothered with making their own dressing, a minus star I take away from my Yelp review of the restaurant.

There has been dispute over the “real creator” of the dish. However, Julia Child’s childhood memories of eating Caesar Salad at Caesar Cardini’s restaurant probably is enough substantial proof. Cardini’s daughter recounted that her father ‘made do’ with what was left in the kitchen on 4th of July 1924 to come up with this now most popular salad dish.

Make sure you use good quality mustard and mayonnaise. Or you can make your own mayonnaise here. If I am not entertaining guests, I substitute mayo with olive oil.

### Ingredients
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> cup mayonnaise or olive oil
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 tbsp anchovy paste
- 3 tbsp grated parmesan cheese
- 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1 tsp Dijon mustard
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 5 anchovy fillets, minced 
- salt, pepper to taste
- shaved parmesan cheese

### Instructions
1. Mix everything together.
1. Toss dressing with Romaine lettuce and croutons.
1. Serve with shaved parmesan cheese.

Note: You can omit the Worcestershire sauce if you are adding anchovy paste.
