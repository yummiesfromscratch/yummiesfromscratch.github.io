Squid Ink pasta has become a trendy and popular dish in the US. This has become a favorite of mine as well as lots of my friends. The ‘seafood umami’ taste that the squid ink adds to the egg rich noodle is a definite plus.

You can purchase squid ink (tinta de calamar) online. However, since I decided to take this challenge last minute, finally after going to WholeFoods and few other local markets, I found little packets of these sold at Draeger’s market (San Mateo store only). I was also told that some Japanese supermarket (ie. Nijiya) sell them (ikasumi).

### Ingredients
- 2 cup flour
- 2 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> tsp salt
- 1 tbsp squid ink (5 of the 0.14oz/4g ink packets)
- 1 tsp olive oil

Suggested Serving Size: 4

Note: the dough can be made 24 hour in advance and kept in the fridge. Take the dough and rest in room temperature for 30 min prior to shaping/cutting it.
