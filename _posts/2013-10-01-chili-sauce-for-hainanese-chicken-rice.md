Hainanese Chicken Rice isn’t complete without these yummy sauces!! WARNING!! Make sure you wear gloves when cutting/seeding chili peppers!!  I seeded 7 serrano chili peppers yesterday and my hands are still burning today!!  I had to ask hubby (much obliged) to help at shower time because my hands couldn’t stand the hot running water which I normally enjoy so much…
