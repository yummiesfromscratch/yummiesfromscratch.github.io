I now follow an annual tradition of making my own moon cake during Autumn Fall Festival. This year, I decided to try making it with the same crust as pineapple cake since I am a big fan of crispier and buttery crust.


![Mooncakes][1]

According to some folk tale, 朱元璋 and 劉伯溫 (famous Ming revolutionaries) used mooncakes to secretly distribute messages in an attempt to overthrow the Mongolian rulers during Yuan dynasty.

Paper back then must not have as much crap as they do today to be safe to stuff inside food…  :)

see [red bean paste filling][2] for recipe on filling
