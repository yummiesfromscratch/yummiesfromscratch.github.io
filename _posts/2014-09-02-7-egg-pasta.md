![Squid Ink Pasta & 7 Egg Pasta][1]

This has gotta be the best noodle recipe that I have tried so far. It is adapted from Thomas Kellerâ€™s recipe collection which has been widely circulated on the web. The texture of the noodle is great, chewy but not rubbery. This pasta dish is a success with the kids and even adults. I can eat plates of this and squid ink pasta (recipe can be found here) with just a light drizzle of olive oil, salt and pepper!

- 6 egg yolks
- 1 whole egg
