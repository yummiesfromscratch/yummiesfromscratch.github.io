This is such an excellent party dish! It’s very colorful appealing to the visual sense and yummy to the palette. You can be creative in terms of the vegetables that you supply. I like a variety of these especially during summer time when you get all these colorful carrots, peppers.

Whenever I host a Vietnamese affair, I often put this for guests as appetizers to keep them ‘occupied’ while I work in the kitchen on the main dish.

Picking a good rice paper is also very important as these will make your life either easy or hard as hell when you try to wrap these without breaking/tearing holes in them. 3 Ladies Brand has consistently been good.
