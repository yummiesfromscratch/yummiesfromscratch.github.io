I remembered as a kid, I used to watch my grandma using a technique called Hot Salt Frying to roast peanuts. The entire house would smell so good from the peanuts and the music made by the crackling peanuts bring back fond memories. However, I also remembered how my grandma used to complain how this cooking technique is damaging to her pots. I suppose I will try one day using my cast iron pans.

For now, my uncle has adapted this recipe to something more practical for urban cooking. 

### Ingredients
- 1 packet of dry raw skin peanuts (12 oz/340 g)
- 1/4 cup of salt

### Instructions
1. Cover peanuts with water and add salt.
1. Soak in salt water for 30 min.
1. Roast in toaster oven 400F for 8 min.
1. Shake the peanuts so they come loose from the pan.
1. Roast in toaster over 350F for another 8 min.
1. Again, shake the peanuts so that they are rotated.
1. Roast in toaster oven at 300F for another 15 min, in 5 min incremental and shaking the pan so that the peanuts are rotated for even roasting.
1. Let peanuts completely cool down before serving.

If you would like to make ground peanuts, skin the roasted peanuts.
Pulse for 3 seconds to coarse powder.
