This is a great simple dessert for your leftover bread!! I prefer using either brioche or challah. But do beware, this is definitely not diet friendly!!

It is best prepared ahead of time and let the bread soak in the cream.

### Ingredients
- 1 lb day old bread cut into 2-inch cubes
- 6 large eggs
- 2/3 cup granulated sugar (plus 1/4 cup for the brulee topping)
- 2 cups whipping cream
- 2 cups milk
- 1 tablespoon vanilla extract
- optional: 1 cup pecans (or raisins, chocolate chips, cranberries, etc.)

### Instructions
1. Grease a 9×13-inch pan. Set aside.
1. Cut bread into 2-inch cubes, place evenly in the pan.
1. In a large bowl, whisk eggs and sugar. Add cream and vanilla extract, and whisk to combine.
1. Pour cream mixture over bread mixture in the pan until completely covered.
1. Gently press down the bread cubes to fully cover with custard.
1. Allow the casserole to sit for 1 hour, covered, at room temperature.

1. Preheat oven to 325F.
1. Press down the berad cubes to ensure bread is moist.
1. Bake for 40-50 minutes or until custard has set and the top is golden brown.
1. If the top is browning too fast, cover loosely with aluminum foil. (Don’t over bake or the bread will be dry.)
1. Let the pudding cool for 30 minutes so that bread contracts.
1. Sprinkle sugar over the top in an even layer and using a torch, cook until sugar melts.
