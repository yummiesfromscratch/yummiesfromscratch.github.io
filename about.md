每一道料理，糕點，都有流傳著『它』的故事

借尋這些美味的由來，讓我們也續篇著我們的日記

Just like 90% of folks living in Silicon Valley, I also work in high tech.

Having worked 12 years at the same tech company following college, I took time off and bought a bakery. Crazy huh…  not really considering it was still the cheaper option to attending B-school.  :)

I am now back in the work force and with a very environmental and health conscious husband who wants to know how cave men/women lived. Any free time we have, I research on how things were made FROM SCRATCH.

Hopefully these wonderful dishes and the natural tastes can continue to be made from scratch in the many kitchens around us.
